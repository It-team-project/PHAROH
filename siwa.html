                Although the oasis is known to have been settled since at least
                the 10th millennium BC, the earliest evidence of any connection with Ancient Egypt
                 is the 26th Dynasty, when a necropolis was established. Ancient Greek settlers at Cyrene made
                 contact with the oasis around the same time (7th century BC), and the oracle temple of Amun (Greek: Zeus Ammon),
                  who, Herodotus was told, took the image here of a ram. Herodotus knew of a "fountain of the Sun"
                  that ran coldest in the noontime heat.[16] During his campaign to conquer the Persian Empire,
                  Alexander the Great reached the oasis, supposedly by following birds across the desert. The oracle,
                  Alexander's court historians alleged, confirmed him as both a divine personage and the legitimate Pharaoh of Egypt,
                  though Alexander's motives in making the excursion, following his founding of Alexandria, remain to some extent inscrutable
                 and contested.[17] During the Ptolemaic Kingdom, its Ancient Egyptian name was sḫ.t-ỉm3w, meaning "Field of Trees".[18]
