    <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza[a] is the largest Egyptian pyramid and tomb of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu.
         Built in the 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years,
         [3] it is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,
         Over time, most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height to the present 138.5 metres (454.4 ft).
         What is seen today is the underlying core structure.
         The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet),
         which includes an internal hillock.</p>

    <p class="enterIntroduction">These have been explored using small robots, but a series of blocking stones have obscured the passages.
     When entering the pyramid, one has to crawl up a cramped ascending chamber that opens suddenly into a stunning space known as the Grand Gallery.
     This corbelled passage soars to a height of 8.74 meters (26 feet) and leads up to the King’s Chamber,
     which is constructed entirely from red granite brought from the southern quarries at Aswan. </p>
     <div class="insidePhotos"></div>
     <p class="insidep">Above the King’s Chamber are five stress-relieving chambers of massive granite blocks topped with
       immense cantilevered slabs forming a pent roof to distribute the weight of the mountain of masonry above it.
       The king’s sarcophagus, also carved from red granite, sits empty at the exact central axis of the pyramid.
       This burial chamber was sealed with a series of massive granite blocks and the entrance to the shaft filled
       with limestone in an effort to obscure the opening.</p>

            <div>Khafre Pyramid</div>
        </div>
        <p>Like the Great Pyramid, a rock outcropping was used in the core.
           Due to the slope of the plateau, the northwest corner was cut 10 m (33 ft) out of the rock subsoil and the southeast corner is built up.
           The pyramid is built of horizontal courses. The stones used at the bottom are very large, but as the pyramid rises,
           the stones become smaller, becoming only 50 cm (20 in) thick at the apex.
           The courses are rough and irregular for the first half of its height but a narrow band of regular masonry is clear in the midsection of the pyramid.
           At the northwest corner of the pyramid, the bedrock was fashioned into steps.
           Casing stones cover the top third of the pyramid, but the pyramidion and part of the apex are missing.
           The bottom course of casing stones was made out of pink granite but the remainder of the pyramid was cased in Tura limestone.
           Close examination reveals that the corner edges of remaining casing stones are not completely straight, but are staggered by a few millimeters.
           One theory is that this is due to settling from seismic activity.
           An alternative theory postulates that the slope on the blocks was cut to shape before being placed due to the
           limited working space towards the top of the pyramid.</p>
        </div>
           <h2 class="theEnter">Size</h2>
           <p class="Size">The pyramid has a base length of 215.5  m (706 ft) and rises up to a height of 136.4 metres (448 ft).
                It is made of limestone blocks weighing more than 2 tons each.
                The slope of the pyramid rises at a 53° 13' angle, steeper than its neighbor, the Pyramid of Khufu, which has an angle of 51°50'24".
                Khafre's pyramid sits on bedrock 10 m (33 ft) higher than Khufu's pyramid, which makes it appear to be taller.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Menkaure's pyramid had an original height of 65.5 meters (215 ft), and was the smallest of the three major pyramids at the Giza Necropolis.
                           It now stands at 61 m (200 ft) tall with a base of 108.5 m (356 ft). Its angle of incline is approximately 51°20′25″.
                           It was constructed of limestone and Aswan granite. The first sixteen courses of the exterior were made of the red granite.
                           The upper portion was cased in the normal manner with Tura limestone. Part of the granite was left in the rough.
                           Incomplete projects such as this pyramid help archaeologists understand the methods used to build pyramids and temples</p>

                    <h2 class="theEnter">Age and Location</h2>
                    <p class="age">The pyramid's date of construction is unknown, because Menkaure's reign has not been accurately defined,
                        but it was probably completed in the 26th century BC. It is a few hundred meters southwest of its larger neighbors,
                        the Pyramid of Khafre and the Great Pyramid of Khufu in the Giza necropolis.</p>
